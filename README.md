# MNIST - Image Classification - DLwP

This repo holds a simple (yet effective) solution to the MNIST dataset as presented in the &#34;Deep Learning with Python&#34; book by Francois Chollet (Manning Publications)

Prerequisites:
* keras
* tensorflow

To-Do:
- Maybe add the requirements to a requirements.txt file and then add the instruction to use `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Add the numerical parameters to a settings file which you'll then import in the classifier.
